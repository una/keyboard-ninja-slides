# How to Become a Keyboard Ninja

A talk given to the IBM Design Developers on keyboard mastery and (mostly) fun tips & tricks on November 3rd.

And then edited and made much better for the [Hill Country JS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/San-Antonio-JavaScript-User-Group/) on November 19th :)

The blank.html and blank.css are files I live coded on for demo purposes.
